# Hi, I'm Isaac!

I usually work on projects driven by curiosity, always aiming for efficiency and a deep understanding of what is happening under the hood.

Most of what I do involves:
- C, my main language for most projects I work on.
- Electronics and robotics, so I’m not limited to just the computer.

In my repositories you’ll find:
- Small projects where I explore ideas.
- Implementations made mainly for learning.
- Ongoing work.

If something looks strange or unfinished, it’s probably because I was testing and learning.

Feel free to look around, clone, or ask questions.
